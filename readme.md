Greetings I am Diont√© Driskell and this is my attempt to create an express user app!

Express User Application:
This is a simple Express application for managing users. It provides a RESTful API for creating and retrieving user data, as well as a web interface for interacting with the API through HTML forms. Created new users via a web form. Added view all users in the system and added access user data through a RESTful API. I was able to download and install json, dependencies and .gitignore files.

Successfully used express,html,javascript, and node modules.
